     * Serializing a BlockStateContainer to a PacketBuffer is done in two parts:
     * calculating the size of the allocation needed in the PacketBuffer, and actually
     * writing it.
     *
     * When the BlockStateContainer is actually written to the PacketBuffer,
     * its 'storage.BitArray.getBackingLongArray' is written as a VarInt-length-prefixed
     * array. However, when calculating the size of the allocation needed, the size of
     * 'storage.size()' encoded as a VarInt is used, not the size of 'getBackingLongArray'
     * encoded as a VarInt. If the size of getBackingLongArray is ever large enough to require
     * an extra byte in its VarInt encoding, the allocated buffer will be too small, resuling in a crash.
     *
     * To fix this issue, we calculate the length of getBackingLongArray encoded as a VarInt,
     * when we're calculating the necessary allocation size.
