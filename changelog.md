# GaryASM Changelog

## 2.6
- Separate out `mixins.modfixes.json` to separate jsons to accompany config values.
- Change BakedQuad logging message to fit current context.
- EXPERIMENTAL: Injecting/Stripping of forge capabilities within the 'dispatcher' of capable classes. This will help in cases where certain capability providers do not need to be attached to the object at all times.
- EXPERIMENTAL: new Astral Sorcery patch `fixAmuletHolderCapability`; uses the previous point to inject and strip AmuletHolderCapability accordingly. This will save RAM depending on how many ItemStacks are present in-world.
- EXPERIMENTAL: new Astral Sorcery patch `optimizeAmuletRelatedFunctions`; now amulet related operations will only run on every tick when the amulet is equipped.

## 2.5
- Cleanups.
- Canonicalize strings by using Java's String#intern. This utilizes Java's own implementation and as of Java 7 through 8, it has gotten better. Where using it is probably better than a custom structure.
- Now uses Forge's own config, but because of earlier-loading, it is manually baked.
- Deprecated old json config system.
- More config options! Check your new configs: `garyasm.cfg`
    - Launchwrapper optimizations into more specific configuration settings.
    - Modfixes are now more specific too.
- NBTTagString objects now have their strings canonicalized.
- Hard-dependency on MixinBooter (2.0).
- Fixes MysticalLib incompatibility (#2).

## 2.4.1
- Fixes static methods containing `BakedQuad::new` not targeted correctly therefore not being redirected.

## 2.4
- Added new module `modFixes`.
- Prevent `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` from occurring in `BlockIEBase#getPushReaction` with special cases.
- Fixes incompatibility with *Wings* because Wings' coremod loads some Forge classes too early for us to mixin into.

## 2.3.1
- Fixes `bakedQuadPatchClasses` not being properly targeted by mixins. This means, GaryASM now requires MixinBooter. It was going to some time down the line anyways.
- Added `miscOptimizations` => aims to optimize smaller areas of the game, nothing game-breaking will be introduced under this.
- `FluidRegistryMixin` => first of `miscOptimizations`, quicker check @ `FluidRegistry::enableUniversalBucket`
- Some more logging

## 2.3
- Reworked config boilerplate, in the worse possible way possible. (thank you `DefaultArtifactVersion`)
- `ModCandidateMixin`: addresses large amounts of duplicate package Strings created by `ModCandidate#addClassEntry`, now it is internally backed by a Set instead and strings are added to the StringPool. `getContainedPackages` return a List constructed from the Set each time.
- New config option: optimizeBitsOfRendering.
- `VisGraphMixin`: removes unboxing business from `floodFill`, and made it use `EnumFacing::values` => `EnumFacing::VALUES`.
- ASM change to `RenderGlobal` => fixes `setupTerrain` using `EnumFacing::values` as opposed to `EnumFacing::VALUES`.
- When ChickenASM is loaded, GaryASM fixes ChickenASM caching a shit ton of superclasses and whatnot in `ClassHierarchyManager`. This isn't used in any ASMing from what I can observe. This change is EXPERIMENTAL!

## 2.2.1
- Fixed crashing when RegistrySimples are created in-world.

## 2.2
- Fixed client classes from being loaded on the server.
- Fixed DummyMap's ClassCircularityError.
- Prevented harmless errors from being logged when mixins aren't being added in certain configurations.

## 2.1
- WIP: Dynamic Model Baking.
- WIP: Speedy Fluid Rendering.
- Optifine now does not crash with GaryASM. Same effect as if you disabled `bakedQuadsSquasher` in configs. The real fix will be addressed soon:tm:.
- I wrote a mixin with ASM, counter-intuitive?
- Added branding, don't be pissed off :^).
- Cleanups.

## 2.0
- Revamped configuration. Some new options there. **REFRESH YOUR CONFIGS**
- Removed soft/hard patch variations for optimizing BakedQuads. Hard patch remains as it is now stable and saves more RAM.
- Implemented 'cleanupLaunchClassLoader' - saves lots of memory in the `LaunchClassLoader` caching things relating to class transformation/loading. *Foamfix* does this already to some fields but I've done it on more fields.
- Implemented 'remapperMemorySaver' - saves lots of memory in `FMLDeobfuscatingRemapper` by deduplicating Strings as well as not caching non-Minecraft/Forge classes/fields/methods.
- Implemented 'optimizeDataStructures' - optimizes structures around Minecraft. This will be updated nearly every version if I find any places that gives tangible results.
- Implemented 'optimizeFurnaceRecipes' - optimizes tick time when searching for FurnaceRecipes. By Hashing recipes and queries are only a hash lookup now rather than a loop => if match => return.
- Starting to implement object canonization, or deduplication as Foamfix calls it, hopefully it will match Foamfix and beat it out. We'll see.
- Starting to implement BlockStateContainer, StateImplementation memory squashers.
- Added mixins to do some of the leg work for me as I'm too lazy to write ASM all the time.
- Cleaned up `GaryReflector`, potentially an API candidate.
- Relocated some coremod classes.

## 1.1
- Fixed issues in some cases (first found in Thaumcraft) where redirecting BakedQuad::new calls would fail because of stackframe issues.

## 1.0
- First release.
- Optimizations on BakedQuads, soft/hard patch variants.
